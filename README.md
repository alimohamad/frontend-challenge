# frontend-challenge

This is the first hackathon project, which I built Saturday - Sunday, February 14-15, 2015. The challenge, if I remember correctly, was to build a website with HTML and CSS about the weekend. I somehow won!

This hackathon (Code Day NJ), this project, really kickstarted my love for hacking and the hacker community. I've been to just under 30 hackathons after this one, 4 years later.

Thank you to everyone who helped and supported me starting with this event and every event after.
