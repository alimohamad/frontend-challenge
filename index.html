	<h1>Code Day NJ 2015.</h1>
	<p>People are out there going on dates, spending time with their "baes", and overall having lots of swaggy fun. You? You're at Code Day. Coding.</p>
</br>
	<p>But I don't regret it for an instant. Today I learned so much about programming, and about myself. I've made  new friends, I've met new people. I can honestly say today, while one of the most tiring days of my life, was most definitely the best. Now without further ado, I've learned a lot today, and I can't wait to share it.</p>

<h3>Intro to Frontend I</h3>
<p>At the start of today, I got sick. Really. Freaking. Sick. My sinuses congested and runny, and my throat hoarse. I was icky, and tired, and unaware of my surroundings. But I still trudged through workshop after workshop, project after project, and then I said to myself, "I don't think this was a very good idea."
</br>
</br>
But then I went to Intro to Frontend I with Su Min Kim.
</br>
</br>	
Being fairly accustomed with HTML and CSS, I found the course to be a fair refresher, but I also learned a fair bit about ways I can improve my html document with external CSS and how to use div classes to alter styling, which is something that had confused me in my own studies and researches. Thank you so much for your help Su Min.

<h3>Intro to Construct 2</h3>
<p>As I have mentioned before, when I was in the Construct workshop, I was DEAD. However, I sucked it up and followed along, even though I wasn't really in the best position to do so. Eventually I gave up, but luckily, the instructor, who was incidentally also the organizer of Code Day, my close friend Steven Abreu, had left an online resource for me to use in the second half of the night. With this resource, I was able to make a game based on a viral video widely enjoyed in my school, and therein something my classmates will most definitely enjoy if not for its lackluster quality, but rather for its existence. Thank you Steven for being such a great teacher and organizer.</p>

<h3>Intro to Frontend II</h3>
<p>Basically, this was the most educational workshop I participated in today; it allowed me to finish the first of the three projects I completed today; a Shakespearean Quote Generator for Valentine's Day. Jay Mo is qhelpinguite possibly one of the best programming teachers I've ever had, and being incredibly helpful in helping me accomplish a project at my first ever hackathon. I was having some issues building the random generator aspect of my website, as it was JavaScript, which, in no way, shape, or form am I adversed in. Luckily, Jay went through all these different aspects of syntax, and when I asked him for help, he made it something of a personal mission of his to help me. From him I learned some basic (or by my standards, intermediate-nearing-difficult) JavaScript, and how to use it like a machine with different parts; by coupling these parts together, you get exactly what you want, and when you do, its absolutely beautiful. Thank you Jay Mo and sleep well.</p>
